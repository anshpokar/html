        Indian nationalism quickly rose to popularity in India through these united anti-colonial coalitions and movements. 
        Independence movement figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru spearheaded the Indian nationalist movement. 
        After Indian Independence, Nehru and his successors continued to campaign on Indian nationalism in face of border 
        wars with both China and Pakistan. After the <abbr title="The Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 was a military confrontation between India and Pakistan that occurred during the Bangladesh Liberation War in East Pakistan from 3 December 1971 until the Pakistani capitulation in Dhaka on 16 December 1971. The war began with Pakistan's Operation Chengiz Khan, consisting of preemptive aerial strikes on eight Indian air stations. The strikes led to India declaring war on Pakistan, marking their entry into the war for East Pakistan's independence, on the side of Bengali nationalist forces. India's entry expanded the existing conflict with Indian and Pakistani forces engaging on both the eastern and western fronts. Thirteen days after the war started, India achieved a clear upper hand, and the Eastern Command of the Pakistan military signed the instrument of surrender on 16 December 1971 in Dhaka, marking the formation of East Pakistan as the new nation of Bangladesh. Approximately 93,000 Pakistani servicemen were taken prisoner by the Indian Army, which included 79,676 to 81,000 uniformed personnel of the Pakistan Armed Forces, including some Bengali soldiers who had remained loyal to Pakistan. The remaining 10,324 to 12,500 prisoners were civilians, either family members of the military personnel or collaborators (Razakars)."> Indo-Pakistan War of 1971</abbr> and the <abbr title="The Bangladesh Liberation War, also known as the Bangladesh War of Independence, or simply the Liberation War in Bangladesh) was a revolution and armed conflict sparked by the rise of the Bengali nationalist and self-determination movement in East Pakistan, which resulted in the independence of Bangladesh.">Bangladesh Liberation War</abbr>, Indian 
        nationalism reached its post-independence peak. However by the 1980s, religious tensions reached a melting point 
        and Indian nationalism sluggishly collapsed. Despite its decline and the rise of religious nationalism; Indian 
        nationalism and its historic figures continue to strongly influence the politics of India and reflect an opposition 
        to the sectarian strands of Hindu nationalism and Muslim nationalism.<br>
